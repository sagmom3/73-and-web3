What is HackFS

The first thing to understand is that HackFS was remote, which means that we were all watching virtually over our computers, from many different places around the world. Before the pandemic, these meetings were held live at various locations around the world. The organizer gathers sponsors and experienced developers to teach about Web3 and share their knowledge and instruction about the knowledge, apps, and tools they have that will lead to the development of new apps for Web3. After spending four weeks participating at the ETHGlobal HackFS event with all the other people, what I came away with is truly remarkable. 

At HackFS, there are hundreds of participants organized into teams working together to build an app to present at the end of the hackathon for judging. This allows for an open exchange of ideas for both new and old developers. The positivity, flow of information, and excitement was evident even in a virtual setting. I found this setting a valuable way to learn, especially when you can go back and go over any information via YouTube. It is all taped! Do you suppose schools might use this method? I found this to be simple and easy, and unlike my learning methods 50+ years ago, I didn't have to take notes. It reminds me of a teacher who would tell some of his students, "what do I have to do, beat it into your head?" It seems that we have gotten there.  

There were many presentations given containing a lot of technical information. Then there were workshops, set up so that everyone could learn how to use all of the technologies presented to us. There were many impressive hand-on demonstrations. Presenter's screens were shown live as the tools were used so participants could observe the completion of tasks and then how different tasks were run. If there was an error, you saw it, and it was fixed right in front of you. It all looked like fun.  

Everyone was encouraged to try new skills no matter their knowledge level. I felt the urge to try it myself except that I didn't even have the basics to try. I've got to say that there were times I thought I was in a cooking class. I started hearing some of the terminology like stacking, layers, and a few others, but my biggest surprise was when I heard someone speaking about a Raspberry Pie. Raspberry Pie! The person spoke about adding information to his Raspberry Pi, and all I could do was picture a Raspberry Pie running around the table.  

Fortunately, I didn't ask them what a Raspberry Pi was and waited and asked my family. I discovered that a Raspberry Pi is simply a little toy-looking thing that can be programmed, but it doesn't have keys or anything else that you would expect to find on something you could program. My grandchildren have one of them, and they're going to learn how to code with it. Now I know, and so do you. At a later session, it turned out that there was an effort being made to build into this Raspberry Pie a way to communicate privately with some other Raspberry Pies using one of the new protocols we had been learning about.

This is partly what a hackathon is all about. Through all these presentations, I started to learn some of the primary attributes of Web3.  

Now is the time to learn about Web3 

Peer-to-peer is a feature that allows some of the developers to even participate in the hackathon. If they had to use a server to communicate, that communication could cause genuine concern that they or their family may suffer some consequences from  their government.  The safety of the user is a real issue in different places around the world. I often wonder how much interference really does happen with the use of servers.  I don't know, but it is a link in the line of communication that could be compromised.   Peer-to-peer allows all of us the ease of communicating with only the ones we want to.

This protocol of communication helps to eliminate any loss either by accident or force.   In an accident, storm or disaster, the loss of one peer still allows contactacting another one.  There is no break or  shut-down.  In areas of the world where systems are blocked, peers can still communicate with one another.  And remember that this can only happen using Web3.  

During this project I was delving into the basics of the Web3 at home.   I found that in everyday life, we can see the influence that using the computer and the internet/web has made both good and bad. So far, the development and subsequent use of Web3 has seemed to offer a much safer, enjoyable option.  The apps developed have one and in some cases two levels of encryption to safeguard important and personal data.   It is just part of how all data is handled to keep you and your data safe and keep it yours alone.  It is an incredible way to hash/lable or code information because it would take years to break into and that’s just for one.  In every case, you and only  you own your information.  Web3 has the potential to eliminate people who try to part you from both your personal information and your money. 

Another piece of information I learned is that Web3 is building and building in a big way.  There is a place for ideas to flourish.  There is not a  place or very little on the current web because of the control by just a few entities.  Little businesses can’t compete.  Web3 has no one controller.  It is open for anyone to try.  Success or failure is there for all to try.  All equal.  

Not knowing anything about developing or coding or how it works, yet my children and grandchildren do, makes me curious. Do I want to learn? Think about what those of us in the older community have been doing... We purchased our computers or laptops or iPads. Then we had to go to that class at the senior center just to learn how to use it. Then what happened? We had an email that helped to write notes to anyone. Why buy stamps and paper! Then we discovered shopping that allowed us spend our time doing fun things. Now we get hit with a pandemic, and now everyone is stuck at home. 

I think this has created a place and time that we can evaluate what is around us and just what we can do. This is a prime time for ideas to flow to help everyone rise above the pandemic's problems and go forward.
But now it reminds me of some other good attributes about Web3.  In the Web3, when you send an email, submit an order to a store, or even deposit money at your bank, you can do it without a server, and no middle-man.  
That should and does mean less bandwidth. That is a good thing.  
All these requests are typically encrypted. That is a good thing.  
Your orders or transactions can be recorded and verifiable. That is a good thing.  
There are many cases that benefit and could be safe, secure, and verifiable using Web3.   


 

Exploring a use-case that affects us all

One of the first areas affected by the pandemic is the doctors and the hospitals. As we get older, these people and places become more critical to our health and well-being. As it was, those doctors and hospitals surged ahead dealing with those affected but in the process at a cost to the rest of us.

I feel fortunate that I live in a small town because I have one or two doctors that I see regularly, and it's very easy for me to communicate with them. I don't think that some people have it that easy. We saw in the recent news that some doctors were taking to the web and visit with their patients online. I know some patients were reluctant and wondered if that was suitable. Not only physically, but there was concern about personal information. With the laws today, privacy is a big issue. I see that as the perfect area for the development of apps, both written and video, for doctors that would be both safe and effective. 

Based on what I learned this month, IPFS would be a suitable technology to build solutions for patients and doctors' needs. We can go ahead with ideas of giving patients their personal information and past medical history. Do you have all your medical history? If you've moved a few times, you probably have as many different histories since you probably told a new physician what you could remember. With technology today, it should be no problem to keep all your medical history right in your pocket either on your phone, your computer, or in a file safely stored away. This history can include all tests, X-rays, and other images that you have ever had to tell a physician. I think that this is a real plus for us as we get older and can't remember everything anymore. Let's be real about that!!  

Many people have also faced challenges when their children grow up and attempt to locate historical medical records. Records may go missing for many reasons, such as when their pediatricians and doctors have retired or died. I know because when I tried to get records for my daughter, I ran into two problems; my daughter was now an adult, no one knew where to find them. It made no difference that it was a time she was an infant and couldn't tell anybody any first-hand information. Trust me, a lot of people don't want to look for you. I love this possible development too because I believe it would cut down on a lot of repetitive tests done by each doctor and cut down on our costs. The other thing that I like is that when I send this information to the doctor when using IPFS, it goes directly to the doctor and no one and no place else, and it is encrypted as another security level.

One report in Discovery indicated that the use of AI artificial intelligence is making headway for doctors to start eliminating valuable time spent in record keeping and such and strt giving their time back to the patient. I see a lot of this potentially working well in Web3 because of decentralized, verifiable, and secure protocols that would benefit both the doctors and us. People can feel secure that their information can't be compromised. 

The future of Web3

I think that this pandemic is only going to accelerate the use of the Web3 because we will see more adults and children using their computers and want apps that are safe and secure. This leads to another project that I saw at HackFS. The developers have been building a tool for businesses to keep payroll records and make payments. When the information for each record in the file is completed, the funds are immediately available for the worker. The record keeps track of all necessary information, and it allows the workers to be paid in the requested cryptocurrency. The worker can later exchange cryptocurrency  for the local currency, such as dollars.   This development pointed out to me the safe atmosphere presented with the information being done on an app that had been built with all the safety protocols embedded and was secure.   It also made me aware that there is a trend to use cryptocurrency in transactions which is inherently secure. It just represents money in a safe, digital way.  It is also an accepted form of currency used in some business transactions.   It is traceable. , 



In the meantime, all these tidbits of information have piqued my curiosity, and I wonder what it would be like to build an app even if only I could use it. I have many areas I would be interested in for the most part because I am blind. There are pluses to using a computer because I can make changes that allow me to see pages better, but there are still times that it is difficult to read. I use video instruction too because it is easier to listen, BUT sometimes the written and picture instructions that are included are not done well enough to see clearly.  

Some areas that interest me are genealogy. I could store information about my family that would be accessible by my family. I could then move my trees from the public sites, such as Ancestry and MyHeritage, which store my information at a price. When I decide not to pay them anymore, my work is no longer accessible to me. I could also buy a program to store my information and can transfer my information. Still, I would like a site that stores the information the way I want to save it, and at the same time, my family will be able to access it anytime in the future.  I find that information on the page to be unsuitable for me to see.  Items are too close and print is too small not bold enough.It would be nice to have apps that would help the blind or visually impared users.  

Along with those same thoughts, I would like to stoWhat is HackFS

Items are too close and print is too small not bold enough.It would be nice to have apps that would help the blind or visually impared users.  

Along with those same thoughts, I would like to store my family pictures and videos and maybe even an audio history but haven’t figured how to plan that out to be  continually updated.  What I like about using  something on the Web3 with IPFS is that everything would be hashed and verifiable for future families.  This is a big step because we have lots of old pictures we can’t alway know for sure it’s validity.  

As I said right in the beginning, I am 73 years old, I have had a very busy life. By my genetic background, I can be around for another 15-20 years and want to be active, keep my brain active, and feel purpose. I would hope that some older and younger people might have some of the same feelings for themselves. It never hurts to learn new things... at any age!!! I hope that you get inspired to learn about and maybe to use Web3, too.

 
Now the first app I would like to build just for me is a file containing names, addresses, and phone numbers. That is possible. But then I'd like to link that to a piece that would listen to me speak my request for information in my app and locate that information and then read back to me the answer. Some expensive devices and services would do that, BUT it would mean a lot more if I did it myself, plus if I built it, it would be just the way I wanted it. I have downloaded a VS Code program and some coding instructions to learn how to build. I have access to ThreadsDB, Buckets, Hub, and Powergate. Then I need to find an audio link to both listen and read. For the answer to my previous question, do I want to learn? YES! So now, I'm off to developing my Audio Read-Write Address Book/Cookbook App just the way I want it.!  

Now to start off though, I think that I should go over to see my granddaughters and together we can try learning a little coding with the Raspberry Pi!
What is HackFS

The first thing to understand is that HackFS was remote, which means that we were all watching virtually over our computers, from many different places around the world. Before the pandemic, these meetings were held live at various locations around the world. The organizer gathers sponsors and experienced developers to teach about Web3 and share their knowledge and instruction about the knowledge, apps, and tools they have that will lead to the development of new apps for Web3. After spending four weeks participating at the ETHGlobal HackFS event with all the other people, what I came away with is truly remarkable. 

At HackFS, there are hundreds of participants organized into teams working together to build an app to present at the end of the hackathon for judging. This allows for an open exchange of ideas for both new and old developers. The positivity, flow of information, and excitement was evident even in a virtual setting. I found this setting a valuable way to learn, especially when you can go back and go over any information via YouTube. It is all taped! Do you suppose schools might use this method? I found this to be simple and easy, and unlike my learning methods 50+ years ago, I didn't have to take notes. It reminds me of a teacher who would tell some of his students, "what do I have to do, beat it into your head?" It seems that we have gotten there.  

There were many presentations given containing a lot of technical information. Then there were workshops, set up so that everyone could learn how to use all of the technologies presented to us. There were many impressive hand-on demonstrations. Presenter's screens were shown live as the tools were used so participants could observe the completion of tasks and then how different tasks were run. If there was an error, you saw it, and it was fixed right in front of you. It all looked like fun.  

Everyone was encouraged to try new skills no matter their knowledge level. I felt the urge to try it myself except that I didn't even have the basics to try. I've got to say that there were times I thought I was in a cooking class. I started hearing some of the terminology like stacking, layers, and a few others, but my biggest surprise was when I heard someone speaking about a Raspberry Pie. Raspberry Pie!

I love this possible development too because I believe it would cut down on a lot of repetitive tests done by each doctor and cut down on our costs. The other thing that I like is that when I send this information to the doctor when using IPFS, it goes directly to the doctor and no one and no place else, and it is encrypted as another security level.

One report in Discovery indicated that the use of AI artificial intelligence is making headway for doctors to start eliminating valuable time spent in record keeping and such and strt giving their time back to the patient. I see a lot of this potentially working well in Web3 because of decentralized, verifiable, and secure protocols that would benefit both the doctors and us. People can feel secure that their information can't be compromised. 

The future of Web3

I think that this pandemic is only going to accelerate the use of the Web3 because we will see more adults and children using their computers and want apps that are safe and secure. This leads to another project that I saw at HackFS. The developers have been building a tool for businesses to keep payroll records and make payments. When the information for each record in the file is completed, the funds are immediately available for the worker. The record keeps track of all necessary information, and it allows the workers to be paid in the requested cryptocurrency. The worker can later exchange cryptocurrency  for the local currency, such as dollars.   This development pointed out to me the safe atmosphere presented with the information being done on an app that had been built with all the safety protocols embedded and was secure.   It also made me aware that there is a trend to use cryptocurrency in transactions which is inherently secure. It just represents money in a safe, digital way.  It is also an accepted form of currency used in some business transactions.   It is traceable. , 



In the meantime, all these tidbits of information have piqued my curiosity, and I wonder what it would be like to build an app even if only I could use it. I have many areas I would be interested in for the most part because I am blind. There are pluses to using a computer because I can make changes that allow me to see pages better, but there are still times that it is difficult to read. I use video instruction too because it is easier to listen, BUT sometimes the written and picture instructions that are included are not done well enough to see clearly.  

Some areas that interest me are genealogy. I could store information about my family that would be accessible by my family. I could then move my trees from the public sites, such as Ancestry and MyHeritage, which store my information at a price. When I decide not to pay them anymore, my work is no longer accessible to me. I could also buy a program to store my information and can transfer my information. Still, I would like a site that stores the information the way I want to save it, and at the same time, my family will be able to access it anytime in the future.  I find that information on the page to be unsuitable for me to see.  Items are too close and print is too small not bold enough.It would be nice to have apps that would help the blind or visually impared users.  

Along with those same thoughts, I would like to store my family pictures and videos and maybe even an audio history but haven’t figured how to plan that out to be  continually updated.  What I like about using  something on the Web3 with IPFS is that everything would be hashed and verifiable for future families.  This is a big step because we have lots of old pictures we can’t alway know for sure it’s validity.  

As I said right in the beginning, I am 73 years old, I have had a very busy life. By my genetic background, I can be around for another 15-20 years and want to be active, keep my brain active, and feel purpose. I would hope that some older and younger people might have some of the same feelings for themselves. It never hurts to learn new things... at any age!!! I hope that you get inspired to learn about and maybe to use Web3, too.

 
Now the first app I would like to build just for me is a file containing names, addresses, and phone numbers. That is possible. But then I'd like to link that to a piece that would listen to me speak my request for information in my app and locate that information and then read back to me the answer. Some expensive devices and services would do that, BUT it would mean a lot more if I did it myself, plus if I built it, it would be just the way I wanted it. I have downloaded a VS Code program and some coding instructions to learn how to build. I have access to ThreadsDB, Buckets, Hub, and Powergate. Then I need to find an audio link to both listen and read. For the answer to my previous question, do I want to learn? YES! So now, I'm off to developing my Audio Read-Write Address Book/Cookbook App just the way I want it.!  

Now to start off though, I think that I should go over to see my granddaughters and together we can try learning a little coding with the Raspberry Pi!
What is HackFS

The first thing to understand is that HackFS was remote, which means that we were all watching virtually over our computers, from many different places around the world. Before the pandemic, these meetings were held live at various locations around the world. The organizer gathers sponsors and experienced developers to teach about Web3 and share their knowledge and instruction about the knowledge, apps, and tools they have that will lead to the development of new apps for Web3. After spending four weeks participating at the ETHGlobal HackFS event with all the other people, what I came away with is truly remarkable. 

At HackFS, there are hundreds of participants organized into teams working together to build an app to present at the end of the hackathon for judging. This allows for an open exchange of ideas for both new and old developers. The positivity, flow of information, and excitement was evident even in a virtual setting. I found this setting a valuable way to learn, especially when you can go back and go over any information via YouTube. It is all taped! Do you suppose schools might use this method? I found this to be simple and easy, and unlike my learning methods 50+ years ago, I didn't have to take notes. It reminds me of a teacher who would tell some of his students, "what do I have to do, beat it into your head?" It seems that we have gotten there.  

There were many presentations given containing a lot of technical information. Then there were workshops, set up so that everyone could learn how to use all of the technologies presented to us. There were many impressive hand-on demonstrations. Presenter's screens were shown live as the tools were used so participants could observe the completion of tasks and then how different tasks were run. If there was an error, you saw it, and it was fixed right in front of you. It all looked like fun.  

Everyone was encouraged to try new skills no matter their knowledge level. I felt the urge to try it myself except that I didn't even have the basics to try. I've got to say that there were times I thought I was in a cooking class. I started hearing some of the terminology like stacking, layers, and a few others, but my biggest surprise was when I heard someone speaking about a Raspberry Pie. Raspberry Pie! The person spoke about adding information to his Raspberry Pi, and all I could do was picture a Raspberry Pie running around the table.  

Fortunately, I didn't ask them what a Raspberry Pi was and waited and asked my family. I discovered that a Raspberry Pi is simply a little toy-looking thing that can be programmed, but it doesn't have keys or anything else that you would expect to find on something you could program. My grandchildren have one of them, and they're going to learn how to code with it. Now I know, and so do you. At a later session, it turned out that there was an effort being made to build into this Raspberry Pie a way to communicate privately with some other Raspberry Pies using one of the new protocols we had been learning about.

This is partly what a hackathon is all about. Through all these presentations, I started to learn some of the primary attributes of Web3.  

Now is the time to learn about Web3 

Peer-to-peer is a feature that allows some of the developers to even participate in the hackathon. If they had to use a server to communicate, that communication could cause genuine concern that they or their family may suffer some consequences from  their government.  The safety of the user is a real issue in different places around the world. I often wonder how much interference really does happen with the use of servers.  I don't know, but it is a link in the line of communication that could be compromised.   Peer-to-peer allows all of us the ease of communicating with only the ones we want to.

This protocol of communication helps to eliminate any loss either by accident or force.   In an accident, storm or disaster, the loss of one peer still allows contactacting another one.  There is no break or  shut-down.  In areas of the world where systems are blocked, peers can still communicate with one another.  And remember that this can only happen using Web3.  

During this project I was delving into the basics of the Web3 at home.   I found that in everyday life, we can see the influence that using the computer and the internet/web has made both good and bad. So far, the development and subsequent use of Web3 has seemed to offer a much safer, enjoyable option.  The apps developed have one and in some cases two levels of encryption to safeguard important and personal data.   It is just part of how all data is handled to keep you and your data safe and keep it yours alone.  It is an incredible way to hash/lable or code information because it would take years to break into and that’s just for one.  In every case, you and only  you own your information.  Web3 has the potential to eliminate people who try to part you from both your personal information and your money. 

Another piece of information I learned is that Web3 is building and building in a big way.  There is a place for ideas to flourish.  There is not a  place or very little on the current web because of the control by just a few entities.  Little businesses can’t compete.  Web3 has no one controller.  It is open for anyone to try.  Success or failure is there for all to try.  All equal.  

Not knowing anything about developing or coding or how it works, yet my children and grandchildren do, makes me curious. Do I want to learn? Think about what those of us in the older community have been doing... We purchased our computers or laptops or iPads. Then we had to go to that class at the senior center just to learn how to use it. Then what happened? We had an email that helped to write notes to anyone. Why buy stamps and paper! Then we discovered shopping that allowed us spend our time doing fun things. Now we get hit with a pandemic, and now everyone is stuck at home. 

I think this has created a place and time that we can evaluate what is around us and just what we can do. This is a prime time for ideas to flow to help everyone rise above the pandemic's problems and go forward.
But now it reminds me of some other good attributes about Web3.  In the Web3, when you send an email, submit an order to a store, or even deposit money at your bank, you can do it without a server, and no middle-man.  
That should and does mean less bandwidth. That is a good thing.  
All these requests are typically encrypted. That is a good thing.  
Your orders or transactions can be recorded and verifiable. That is a good thing.  
There are many cases that benefit and could be safe, secure, and verifiable using Web3.   


 

Exploring a use-case that affects us all

One of the first areas affected by the pandemic is the doctors and the hospitals. As we get older, these people and places become more critical to our health and well-being. As it was, those doctors and hospitals surged ahead dealing with those affected but in the process at a cost to the rest of us.

I feel fortunate that I live in a small town because I have one or two doctors that I see regularly, and it's very easy for me to communicate with them. I don't think that some people have it that easy. We saw in the recent news that some doctors were taking to the web and visit with their patients online. I know some patients were reluctant and wondered if that was suitable. Not only physically, but there was concern about personal information. With the laws today, privacy is a big issue. I see that as the perfect area for the development of apps, both written and video, for doctors that would be both safe and effective. 

Based on what I learned this month, IPFS would be a suitable technology to build solutions for patients and doctors' needs. We can go ahead with ideas of giving patients their personal information and past medical history. Do you have all your medical history? If you've moved a few times, you probably have as many different histories since you probably told a new physician what you could remember. With technology today, it should be no problem to keep all your medical history right in your pocket either on your phone, your computer, or in a file safely stored away. This history can include all tests, X-rays, and other images that you have ever had to tell a physician. I think that this is a real plus for us as we get older and can't remember everything anymore. Let's be real about that!!  

Many people have also faced challenges when their children grow up and attempt to locate historical medical records. Records may go missing for many reasons, such as when their pediatricians and doctors have retired or died. I know because when I tried to get records for my daughter, I ran into two problems; my daughter was now an adult, no one knew where to find them. It made no difference that it was a time she was an infant and couldn't tell anybody any first-hand information. Trust me, a lot of people don't want to look for you. I love this possible development too because I believe it would cut down on a lot of repetitive tests done by each doctor and cut down on our costs. The other thing that I like is that when I send this information to the doctor when using IPFS, it goes directly to the doctor and no one and no place else, and it is encrypted as another security level.

One report in Discovery indicated that the use of AI artificial intelligence is making headway for doctors to start eliminating valuable time spent in record keeping and such and strt giving their time back to the patient. I see a lot of this potentially working well in Web3 because of decentralized, verifiable, and secure protocols that would benefit both the doctors and us. People can feel secure that their information can't be compromised.

I think that this pandemic is only going to accelerate the use of the Web3 because we will see more adults and children using their computers and want apps that are safe and secure. This leads to another project that I saw at HackFS. The developers have been building a tool for businesses to keep payroll records and make payments. When the information for each record in the file is completed, the funds are immediately available for the worker. The record keeps track of all necessary information, and it allows the workers to be paid in the requested cryptocurrency. The worker can later exchange cryptocurrency  for the local currency, such as dollars.   This development pointed out to me the safe atmosphere presented with the information being done on an app that had been built with all the safety protocols embedded and was secure.   It also made me aware that there is a trend to use cryptocurrency in transactions which is inherently secure. It just represents money in a safe, digital way.  It is also an accepted form of currency used in some business transactions.   It is traceable. , 



In the meantime, all these tidbits of information have piqued my curiosity, and I wonder what it would be like to build an app even if only I could use it.

I use video instruction too because it is easier to listen, BUT sometimes the written and picture instructions that are included are not done well enough to see clearly.  

Some areas that interest me are genealogy. I could store information about my family that would be accessible by my family. I could then move my trees from the public sites, such as Ancestry and MyHeritage, which store my information at a price. When I decide not to pay them anymore, my work is no longer accessible to me. I could also buy a program to store my information and can transfer my information. Still, I would like a site that stores the information the way I want to save it, and at the same time, my family will be able to access it anytime in the future.  I find that information on the page to be unsuitable for me to see.  Items are too close and print is too small not bold enough.It would be nice to have apps that would help the blind or visually impared users.  

Along with those same thoughts, I would like to store my family pictures and videos and maybe even an audio history but haven’t figured how to plan that out to be  continually updated.  What I like about using  something on the Web3 with IPFS is that everything would be hashed and verifiable for future families.  This is a big step because we have lots of old pictures we can’t alway know for sure it’s validity.  

As I said right in the beginning, I am 73 years old, I have had a very busy life. By my genetic background, I can be around for another 15-20 years and want to be active, keep my brain active, and feel purpose. I would hope that some older and younger people might have some of the same feelings for themselves. It never hurts to learn new things... at any age!!! I hope that you get inspired to learn about and maybe to use Web3, too.

If there was an error, you saw it, and it was fixed right in front of you. It all looked like fun.  

Everyone was encouraged to try new skills no matter their knowledge level. I felt the urge to try it myself except that I didn't even have the basics to try. I've got to say that there were times I thought I was in a cooking class. I started hearing some of the terminology like stacking, layers, and a few others, but my biggest surprise was when I heard someone speaking about a Raspberry Pie. Raspberry Pie! The person spoke about adding information to his Raspberry Pi, and all I could do was picture a Raspberry Pie running around the table.  

Fortunately, I didn't ask them what a Raspberry Pi was and waited and asked my family. I discovered that a Raspberry Pi is simply a little toy-looking thing that can be programmed, but it doesn't have keys or anything else that you would expect to find on something you could program. My grandchildren have one of them, and they're going to learn how to code with it. Now I know, and so do you. At a later session, it turned out that there was an effort being made to build into this Raspberry Pie a way to communicate privately with some other Raspberry Pies using one of the new protocols we had been learning about.

This is partly what a hackathon is all about. Through all these presentations, I started to learn some of the primary attributes of Web3.  

Now is the time to learn about Web3 

Peer-to-peer is a feature that allows some of the developers to even participate in the hackathon. If they had to use a server to communicate, that communication could cause genuine concern that they or their family may suffer some consequences from  their government.  The safety of the user is a real issue in different places around the world. I often wonder how much interference really does happen with the use of servers.  I don't know, but it is a link in the line of communication that could be compromised.   Peer-to-peer allows all of us the ease of communicating with only the ones we want to.

This protocol of communication helps to eliminate any loss either by accident or force.   In an accident, storm or disaster, the loss of one peer still allows contactacting another one.  There is no break or  shut-down.  In areas of the world where systems are blocked, peers can still communicate with one another.  And remember that this can only happen using Web3.  

During this project I was delving into the basics of the Web3 at home.   I found that in everyday life, we can see the influence that using the computer and the internet/web has made both good and bad. So far, the development and subsequent use of Web3 has seemed to offer a much safer, enjoyable option.  The apps developed have one and in some cases two levels of encryption to safeguard important and personal data.   It is just part of how all data is handled to keep you and your data safe and keep it yours alone.  It is an incredible way to hash/lable or code information because it would take years to break into and that’s just for one.  In every case, you and only  you own your information.  Web3 has the potential to eliminate people who try to part you from both your personal information and your money. 

Another piece of information I learned is that Web3 is building and building in a big way.  There is a place for ideas to flourish.  There is not a  place or very little on the current web because of the control by just a few entities.  Little businesses can’t compete.  Web3 has no one controller.  It is open for anyone to try.  Success or failure is there for all to try.  All equal.  

Not knowing anything about developing or coding or how it works, yet my children and grandchildren do, makes me curious. Do I want to learn? Think about what those of us in the older community have been doing... We purchased our computers or laptops or iPads. Then we had to go to that class at the senior center just to learn how to use it. Then what happened? We had an email that helped to write notes to anyone. Why buy stamps and paper! Then we discovered shopping that allowed us spend our time doing fun things. Now we get hit with a pandemic, and now everyone is stuck at home. 

I think this has created a place and time that we can evaluate what is around us and just what we can do. This is a prime time for ideas to flow to help everyone rise above the pandemic's problems and go forward.
But now it reminds me of some other good attributes about Web3.  In the Web3, when you send an email, submit an order to a store, or even deposit money at your bank, you can do it without a server, and no middle-man.  
That should and does mean less bandwidth. That is a good thing.  
All these requests are typically encrypted. That is a good thing.  
Your orders or transactions can be recorded and verifiable. That is a good thing.  
There are many cases that benefit and could be safe, secure, and verifiable using Web3.   


 

Exploring a use-case that affects us all

One of the first areas affected by the pandemic is the doctors and the hospitals. As we get older, these people and places become more critical to our health and well-being. As it was, those doctors and hospitals surged ahead dealing with those affected but in the process at a cost to the rest of us.

I feel fortunate that I live in a small town because I have one or two doctors that I see regularly, and it's very easy for me to communicate with them. I don't think that some people have it that easy. We saw in the recent news that some doctors were taking to the web and visit with their patients online. I know some patients were reluctant and wondered if that was suitable. Not only physically, but there was concern about personal information. With the laws today, privacy is a big issue. I see that as the perfect area for the development of apps, both written and video, for doctors that would be both safe and effective. 

Based on what I learned this month, IPFS would be a suitable technology to build solutions for patients and doctors' needs. We can go ahead with ideas of giving patients their personal information and past medical history. Do you have all your medical history? If you've moved a few times, you probably have as many different histories since you probably told a new physician what you could remember. With technology today, it should be no problem to keep all your medical history right in your pocket either on your phone, your computer, or in a file safely stored away. This history can include all tests, X-rays, and other images that you have ever had to tell a physician. I think that this is a real plus for us as we get older and can't remember everything anymore. Let's be real about that!!  

Many people have also faced challenges when their children grow up and attempt to locate historical medical records. Records may go missing for many reasons, such as when their pediatricians and doctors have retired or died. I know because when I tried to get records for my daughter, I ran into two problems; my daughter was now an adult, no one knew where to find them. It made no difference that it was a time she was an infant and couldn't tell anybody any first-hand information. Trust me, a lot of people don't want to look for you. I love this possible development too because I believe it would cut down on a lot of repetitive tests done by each doctor and cut down on our costs. The other thing that I like is that when I send this information to the doctor when using IPFS, it goes directly to the doctor and no one and no place else, and it is encrypted as another security level.

One report in Discovery indicated that the use of AI artificial intelligence is making headway for doctors to start eliminating valuable time spent in record keeping and such and strt giving their time back to the patient. I see a lot of this potentially working well in Web3 because of decentralized, verifiable, and secure protocols that would benefit both the doctors and us. People can feel secure that their information can't be compromised. 

The future of Web3

I think that this pandemic is only going to accelerate the use of the Web3 because we will see more adults and children using their computers and want apps that are safe and secure. This leads to another project that I saw at HackFS. The developers have been building a tool for businesses to keep payroll records and make payments. When the information for each record in the file is completed, the funds are immediately available for the worker. The record keeps track of all necessary information, and it allows the workers to be paid in the requested cryptocurrency. The worker can later exchange cryptocurrency  for the local currency, such as dollars.   This development pointed out to me the safe atmosphere presented with the information being done on an app that had been built with all the safety protocols embedded and was secure.   It also made me aware that there is a trend to use cryptocurrency in transactions which is inherently secure. It just represents money in a safe, digital way.  It is also an accepted form of currency used in some business transactions.   It is traceable. , 



In the meantime, all these tidbits of information have piqued my curiosity, and I wonder what it would be like to build an app even if only I could use it. I have many areas I would be interested in for the most part because I am blind. There are pluses to using a computer because I can make changes that allow me to see pages better, but there are still times that it is difficult to read. I use video instruction too because it is easier to listen, BUT sometimes the written and picture instructions that are included are not done well enough to see clearly.  

Some areas that interest me are genealogy. I could store information about my family that would be accessible by my family. I could then move my trees from the public sites, such as Ancestry and MyHeritage, which store my information at a price. When I decide not to pay them anymore, my work is no longer accessible to me. I could also buy a program to store my information and can transfer my information. Still, I would like a site that stores the information the way I want to save it, and at the same time, my family will be able to access it anytime in the future.  I find that information on the page to be unsuitable for me to see.  Items are too close and print is too small not bold enough.It would be nice to have apps that would help the blind or visually impared users.  

Along with those same thoughts, I would like to store my family pictures and videos and maybe even an audio history but haven’t figured how to plan that out to be  continually updated.  What I like about using  something on the Web3 with IPFS is that everything would be hashed and verifiable for future families.  This is a big step because we have lots of old pictures we can’t alway know for sure it’s validity.  

As I said right in the beginning, I am 73 years old, I have had a very busy life. By my genetic background, I can be around for another 15-20 years and want to be active, keep my brain active, and feel purpose. I would hope that some older and younger people might have some of the same feelings for themselves. It never hurts to learn new things... at any age!!! I hope that you get inspired to learn about and maybe to use Web3, too.

 
Now the first app I would like to build just for me is a file containing names, addresses, and phone numbers. That is possible. But then I'd like to link that to a piece that would listen to me speak my request for information in my app and locate that information and then read back to me the answer. Some expensive devices and services would do that, BUT it would mean a lot more if I did it myself, plus if I built it, it would be just the way I wanted it. I have downloaded a VS Code program and some coding instructions to learn how to build. I have access to ThreadsDB, Buckets, Hub, and Powergate. Then I need to find an audio link to both listen and read. For the answer to my previous question, do I want to learn? YES! So now, I'm off to developing my Audio Read-Write Address Book/Cookbook App just the way I want it.!  

Now to start off though, I think that I should go over to see my granddaughters and together we can try learning a little coding with the Raspberry Pi!
What is HackFS

The first thing to understand is that HackFS was remote, which means that we were all watching virtually over our computers, from many different places around the world. Before the pandemic, these meetings were held live at various locations around the world. The organizer gathers sponsors and experienced developers to teach about Web3 and share their knowledge and instruction about the knowledge, apps, and tools they have that will lead to the development of new apps for Web3. After spending four weeks participating at the ETHGlobal HackFS event with all the other people, what I came away with is truly remarkable. 

At HackFS, there are hundreds of participants organized into teams working together to build an app to present at the end of the hackathon for judging. This allows for an open exchange of ideas for both new and old developers. The positivity, flow of information, and excitement was evident even in a virtual setting. I found this setting a valuable way to learn, especially when you can go back and go over any information via YouTube. It is all taped! Do you suppose schools might use this method? I found this to be simple and easy, and unlike my learning methods 50+ years ago, I didn't have to take notes. It reminds me of a teacher who would tell some of his students, "what do I have to do, beat it into your head?" It seems that we have gotten there.  

There were many presentations given containing a lot of technical information. Then there were workshops, set up so that everyone could learn how to use all of the technologies presented to us. There were many impressive hand-on demonstrations. Presenter's screens were shown live as the tools were used so participants could observe the completion of tasks and then how different tasks were run. If there was an error, you saw it, and it was fixed right in front of you. It all looked like fun.

There are many cases that benefit and could be safe, secure, and verifiable using Web3.   


 

Exploring a use-case that affects us all

One of the first areas affected by the pandemic is the doctors and the hospitals. As we get older, these people and places become more critical to our health and well-being. As it was, those doctors and hospitals surged ahead dealing with those affected but in the process at a cost to the rest of us.

I feel fortunate that I live in a small town because I have one or two doctors that I see regularly, and it's very easy for me to communicate with them. I don't think that some people have it that easy. We saw in the recent news that some doctors were taking to the web and visit with their patients online. I know some patients were reluctant and wondered if that was suitable. Not only physically, but there was concern about personal information. With the laws today, privacy is a big issue. I see that as the perfect area for the development of apps, both written and video, for doctors that would be both safe and effective. 

Based on what I learned this month, IPFS would be a suitable technology to build solutions for patients and doctors' needs. We can go ahead with ideas of giving patients their personal information and past medical history. Do you have all your medical history? If you've moved a few times, you probably have as many different histories since you probably told a new physician what you could remember. With technology today, it should be no problem to keep all your medical history right in your pocket either on your phone, your computer, or in a file safely stored away. This history can include all tests, X-rays, and other images that you have ever had to tell a physician. I think that this is a real plus for us as we get older and can't remember everything anymore. Let's be real about that!!  

Many people have also faced challenges when their children grow up and attempt to locate historical medical records. Records may go missing for many reasons, such as when their pediatricians and doctors have retired or died. I know because when I tried to get records for my daughter, I ran into two problems; my daughter was now an adult, no one knew where to find them. It made no difference that it was a time she was an infant and couldn't tell anybody any first-hand information. Trust me, a lot of people don't want to look for you. I love this possible development too because I believe it would cut down on a lot of repetitive tests done by each doctor and cut down on our costs. The other thing that I like is that when I send this information to the doctor when using IPFS, it goes directly to the doctor and no one and no place else, and it is encrypted as another security level.

One report in Discovery indicated that the use of AI artificial intelligence is making headway for doctors to start eliminating valuable time spent in record keeping and such and strt giving their time back to the patient. I see a lot of this potentially working well in Web3 because of decentralized, verifiable, and secure protocols that would benefit both the doctors and us. People can feel secure that their information can't be compromised. 

The future of Web3

I think that this pandemic is only going to accelerate the use of the Web3 because we will see more adults and children using their computers and want apps that are safe and secure. This leads to another project that I saw at HackFS. The developers have been building a tool for businesses to keep payroll records and make payments. When the information for each record in the file is completed, the funds are immediately available for the worker. The record keeps track of all necessary information, and it allows the workers to be paid in the requested cryptocurrency. The worker can later exchange cryptocurrency  for the local currency, such as dollars.   This development pointed out to me the safe atmosphere presented with the information being done on an app that had been built with all the safety protocols embedded and was secure.   It also made me aware that there is a trend to use cryptocurrency in transactions which is inherently secure. It just represents money in a safe, digital way.  It is also an accepted form of currency used in some business transactions.   It is traceable. , 



In the meantime, all these tidbits of information have piqued my curiosity, and I wonder what it would be like to build an app even if only I could use it. I have many areas I would be interested in for the most part because I am blind. There are pluses to using a computer because I can make changes that allow me to see pages better, but there are still times that it is difficult to read. I use video instruction too because it is easier to listen, BUT sometimes the written and picture instructions that are included are not done well enough to see clearly.  

Some areas that interest me are genealogy. I could store information about my family that would be accessible by my family. I could then move my trees from the public sites, such as Ancestry and MyHeritage, which store my information at a price. When I decide not to pay them anymore, my work is no longer accessible to me. I could also buy a program to store my information and can transfer my information. Still, I would like a site that stores the information the way I want to save it, and at the same time, my family will be able to access it anytime in the future.  I find that information on the page to be unsuitable for me to see.  Items are too close and print is too small not bold enough.It would be nice to have apps that would help the blind or visually impared users.  

Along with those same thoughts, I would like to store my family pictures and videos and maybe even an audio history but haven’t figured how to plan that out to be  continually updated.  What I like about using  something on the Web3 with IPFS is that everything would be hashed and verifiable for future families.  This is a big step because we have lots of old pictures we can’t alway know for sure it’s validity.  

As I said right in the beginning, I am 73 years old, I have had a very busy life. By my genetic background, I can be around for another 15-20 years and want to be active, keep my brain active, and feel purpose. I would hope that some older and younger people might have some of the same feelings for themselves. It never hurts to learn new things... at any age!!! I hope that you get inspired to learn about and maybe to use Web3, too.

 
Now the first app I would like to build just for me is a file containing names, addresses, and phone numbers. That is possible. But then I'd like to link that to a piece that would listen to me speak my request for information in my app and locate that information and then read back to me the answer. Some expensive devices and services would do that, BUT it would mean a lot more if I did it myself, plus if I built it, it would be just the way I wanted it. I have downloaded a VS Code program and some coding instructions to learn how to build. I have access to ThreadsDB, Buckets, Hub, and Powergate. Then I need to find an audio link to both listen and read. For the answer to my previous question, do I want to learn? YES! So now, I'm off to developing my Audio Read-Write Address Book/Cookbook App just the way I want it.!  

Now to start off though, I think that I should go over to see my granddaughters and together we can try learning a little coding with the Raspberry Pi!
What is HackFS

The first thing to understand is that HackFS was remote, which means that we were all watching virtually over our computers, from many different places around the world. Before the pandemic, these meetings were held live at various locations around the world. The organizer gathers sponsors and experienced developers to teach about Web3 and share their knowledge and instruction about the knowledge, apps, and tools they have that will lead to the development of new apps for Web3. After spending four weeks participating at the ETHGlobal HackFS event with all the other people, what I came away with is truly remarkable. 

At HackFS, there are hundreds of participants organized into teams working together to build an app to present at the end of the hackathon for judging. This allows for an open exchange of ideas for both new and old developers. The positivity, flow of information, and excitement was evident even in a virtual setting. I found this setting a valuable way to learn, especially when you can go back and go over any information via YouTube. It is all taped! Do you suppose schools might use this method? I found this to be simple and easy, and unlike my learning methods 50+ years ago, I didn't have to take notes. It reminds me of a teacher who would tell some of his students, "what do I have to do, beat it into your head?" It seems that we have gotten there.  

There were many presentations given containing a lot of technical information. Then there were workshops, set up so that everyone could learn how to use all of the technologies presented to us. There were many impressive hand-on demonstrations. Presenter's screens were shown live as the tools were used so participants could observe the completion of tasks and then how different tasks were run. If there was an error, you saw it, and it was fixed right in front of you. It all looked like fun.  

Everyone was encouraged to try new skills no matter their knowledge level. I felt the urge to try it myself except that I didn't even have the basics to try. I've got to say that there were times I thought I was in a cooking class. I started hearing some of the terminology like stacking, layers, and a few others, but my biggest surprise was when I heard someone speaking about a Raspberry Pie. Raspberry Pie! The person spoke about adding information to his Raspberry Pi, and all I could do was picture a Raspberry Pie running around the table.  

Fortunately, I didn't ask them what a Raspberry Pi was and waited and asked my family. I discovered that a Raspberry Pi is simply a little toy-looking thing that can be programmed, but it doesn't have keys or anything else that you would expect to find on something you could program. My grandchildren have one of them, and they're going to learn how to code with it. Now I know, and so do you. At a later session, it turned out that there was an effort being made to build into this Raspberry Pie a way to communicate privately with some other Raspberry Pies using one of the new protocols we had been learning about.

This is partly what a hackathon is all about. Through all these presentations, I started to learn some of the primary attributes of Web3.  

Now is the time to learn about Web3 

Peer-to-peer is a feature that allows some of the developers to even participate in the hackathon. If they had to use a server to communicate, that communication could cause genuine concern that they or their family may suffer some consequences from  their government.  The safety of the user is a real issue in different places around the world. I often wonder how much interference really does happen with the use of servers.  I don't know, but it is a link in the line of communication that could be compromised.   Peer-to-peer allows all of us the ease of communicating with only the ones we want to.

This protocol of communication helps to eliminate any loss either by accident or force.   In an accident, storm or disaster, the loss of one peer still allows contactacting another one.  There is no break or  shut-down.  In areas of the world where systems are blocked, peers can still communicate with one another.  And remember that this can only happen using Web3.  

During this project I was delving into the basics of the Web3 at home.   I found that in everyday life, we can see the influence that using the computer and the internet/web has made both good and bad. So far, the development and subsequent use of Web3 has seemed to offer a much safer, enjoyable option.  The apps developed have one and in some cases two levels of encryption to safeguard important and personal data.   It is just part of how all data is handled to keep you and your data safe and keep it yours alone.  It is an incredible way to hash/lable or code information because it would take years to break into and that’s just for one.  In every case, you and only  you own your information.  Web3 has the potential to eliminate people who try to part you from both your personal information and your money. 

Another piece of information I learned is that Web3 is building and building in a big way.  There is a place for ideas to flourish.  There is not a  place or very little on the current web because of the control by just a few entities.  Little businesses can’t compete.  Web3 has no one controller.  It is open for anyone to try.  Success or failure is there for all to try.  All equal.  

Not knowing anything about developing or coding or how it works, yet my children and grandchildren do, makes me curious. Do I want to learn? Think about what those of us in the older community have been doing... We purchased our computers or laptops or iPads. Then we had to go to that class at the senior center just to learn how to use it. Then what happened? We had an email that helped to write notes to anyone. Why buy stamps and paper! Then we discovered shopping that allowed us spend our time doing fun things. Now we get hit with a pandemic, and now everyone is stuck at home. 

I think this has created a place and time that we can evaluate what is around us and just what we can do. This is a prime time for ideas to flow to help everyone rise above the pandemic's problems and go forward.
But now it reminds me of some other good attributes about Web3.  In the Web3, when you send an email, submit an order to a store, or even deposit money at your bank, you can do it without a server, and no middle-man.  
That should and does mean less bandwidth. That is a good thing.  
All these requests are typically encrypted. That is a good thing.  
Your orders or transactions can be recorded and verifiable. That is a good thing.  
There are many cases that benefit and could be safe, secure, and verifiable using Web3.

I have downloaded a VS Code program and some coding instructions to learn how to build. I have access to ThreadsDB, Buckets, Hub, and Powergate. Then I need to find an audio link to both listen and read. For the answer to my previous question, do I want to learn? YES! So now, I'm off to developing my Audio Read-Write Address Book/Cookbook App just the way I want it.!  

Now to start off though, I think that I should go over to see my granddaughters and together we can try learning a little coding with the Raspberry Pi!
What is HackFS

The first thing to understand is that HackFS was remote, which means that we were all watching virtually over our computers, from many different places around the world. Before the pandemic, these meetings were held live at various locations around the world. The organizer gathers sponsors and experienced developers to teach about Web3 and share their knowledge and instruction about the knowledge, apps, and tools they have that will lead to the development of new apps for Web3. After spending four weeks participating at the ETHGlobal HackFS event with all the other people, what I came away with is truly remarkable. 

At HackFS, there are hundreds of participants organized into teams working together to build an app to present at the end of the hackathon for judging. This allows for an open exchange of ideas for both new and old developers. The positivity, flow of information, and excitement was evident even in a virtual setting. I found this setting a valuable way to learn, especially when you can go back and go over any information via YouTube. It is all taped! Do you suppose schools might use this method? I found this to be simple and easy, and unlike my learning methods 50+ years ago, I didn't have to take notes. It reminds me of a teacher who would tell some of his students, "what do I have to do, beat it into your head?" It seems that we have gotten there.  

There were many presentations given containing a lot of technical information. Then there were workshops, set up so that everyone could learn how to use all of the technologies presented to us. There were many impressive hand-on demonstrations. Presenter's screens were shown live as the tools were used so participants could observe the completion of tasks and then how different tasks were run. If there was an error, you saw it, and it was fixed right in front of you. It all looked like fun.  

Everyone was encouraged to try new skills no matter their knowledge level. I felt the urge to try it myself except that I didn't even have the basics to try. I've got to say that there were times I thought I was in a cooking class. I started hearing some of the terminology like stacking, layers, and a few others, but my biggest surprise was when I heard someone speaking about a Raspberry Pie. Raspberry Pie! The person spoke about adding information to his Raspberry Pi, and all I could do was picture a Raspberry Pie running around the table.  

Fortunately, I didn't ask them what a Raspberry Pi was and waited and asked my family. I discovered that a Raspberry Pi is simply a little toy-looking thing that can be programmed, but it doesn't have keys or anything else that you would expect to find on something you could program. My grandchildren have one of them, and they're going to learn how to code with it. Now I know, and so do you. At a later session, it turned out that there was an effort being made to build into this Raspberry Pie a way to communicate privately with some other Raspberry Pies using one of the new protocols we had been learning about.

This is partly what a hackathon is all about. Through all these presentations, I started to learn some of the primary attributes of Web3.  

Now is the time to learn about Web3 

Peer-to-peer is a feature that allows some of the developers to even participate in the hackathon. If they had to use a server to communicate, that communication could cause genuine concern that they or their family may suffer some consequences from  their government.  The safety of the user is a real issue in different places around the world. I often wonder how much interference really does happen with the use of servers.  I don't know, but it is a link in the line of communication that could be compromised.   Peer-to-peer allows all of us the ease of communicating with only the ones we want to.

This protocol of communication helps to eliminate any loss either by accident or force.   In an accident, storm or disaster, the loss of one peer still allows contactacting another one.  There is no break or  shut-down.  In areas of the world where systems are blocked, peers can still communicate with one another.  And remember that this can only happen using Web3.  

During this project I was delving into the basics of the Web3 at home.   I found that in everyday life, we can see the influence that using the computer and the internet/web has made both good and bad. So far, the development and subsequent use of Web3 has seemed to offer a much safer, enjoyable option.  The apps developed have one and in some cases two levels of encryption to safeguard important and personal data.   It is just part of how all data is handled to keep you and your data safe and keep it yours alone.  It is an incredible way to hash/lable or code information because it would take years to break into and that’s just for one.  In every case, you and only  you own your information.  Web3 has the potential to eliminate people who try to part you from both your personal information and your money. 

Another piece of information I learned is that Web3 is building and building in a big way.  There is a place for ideas to flourish.  There is not a  place or very little on the current web because of the control by just a few entities.  Little businesses can’t compete.  Web3 has no one controller.  It is open for anyone to try.  Success or failure is there for all to try.  All equal.  

Not knowing anything about developing or coding or how it works, yet my children and grandchildren do, makes me curious. Do I want to learn? Think about what those of us in the older community have been doing... We purchased our computers or laptops or iPads. Then we had to go to that class at the senior center just to learn how to use it. Then what happened? We had an email that helped to write notes to anyone. Why buy stamps and paper! Then we discovered shopping that allowed us spend our time doing fun things. Now we get hit with a pandemic, and now everyone is stuck at home. 

I think this has created a place and time that we can evaluate what is around us and just what we can do. This is a prime time for ideas to flow to help everyone rise above the pandemic's problems and go forward.
But now it reminds me of some other good attributes about Web3.  In the Web3, when you send an email, submit an order to a store, or even deposit money at your bank, you can do it without a server, and no middle-man.  
That should and does mean less bandwidth. That is a good thing.  
All these requests are typically encrypted. That is a good thing.  
Your orders or transactions can be recorded and verifiable. That is a good thing.  
There are many cases that benefit and could be safe, secure, and verifiable using Web3.   


 

Exploring a use-case that affects us all

One of the first areas affected by the pandemic is the doctors and the hospitals. As we get older, these people and places become more critical to our health and well-being. As it was, those doctors and hospitals surged ahead dealing with those affected but in the process at a cost to the rest of us.

I feel fortunate that I live in a small town because I have one or two doctors that I see regularly, and it's very easy for me to communicate with them. I don't think that some people have it that easy. We saw in the recent news that some doctors were taking to the web and visit with their patients online. I know some patients were reluctant and wondered if that was suitable. Not only physically, but there was concern about personal information. With the laws today, privacy is a big issue. I see that as the perfect area for the development of apps, both written and video, for doctors that would be both safe and effective. 

Based on what I learned this month, IPFS would be a suitable technology to build solutions for patients and doctors' needs. We can go ahead with ideas of giving patients their personal information and past medical history. Do you have all your medical history? If you've moved a few times, you probably have as many different histories since you probably told a new physician what you could remember. With technology today, it should be no problem to keep all your medical history right in your pocket either on your phone, your computer, or in a file safely stored away. This history can include all tests, X-rays, and other images that you have ever had to tell a physician. I think that this is a real plus for us as we get older and can't remember everything anymore. Let's be real about that!!  

Many people have also faced challenges when their children grow up and attempt to locate historical medical records. Records may go missing for many reasons, such as when their pediatricians and doctors have retired or died. I know because when I tried to get records for my daughter, I ran into two problems; my daughter was now an adult, no one knew where to find them. It made no difference that it was a time she was an infant and couldn't tell anybody any first-hand information. Trust me, a lot of people don't want to look for you. I love this possible development too because I believe it would cut down on a lot of repetitive tests done by each doctor and cut down on our costs. The other thing that I like is that when I send this information to the doctor when using IPFS, it goes directly to the doctor and no one and no place else, and it is encrypted as another security level.

One report in Discovery indicated that the use of AI artificial intelligence is making headway for doctors to start eliminating valuable time spent in record keeping and such and strt giving their time back to the patient. I see a lot of this potentially working well in Web3 because of decentralized, verifiable, and secure protocols that would benefit both the doctors and us. People can feel secure that their information can't be compromised. 

The future of Web3

I think that this pandemic is only going to accelerate the use of the Web3 because we will see more adults and children using their computers and want apps that are safe and secure. This leads to another project that I saw at HackFS. The developers have been building a tool for businesses to keep payroll records and make payments. When the information for each record in the file is completed, the funds are immediately available for the worker. The record keeps track of all necessary information, and it allows the workers to be paid in the requested cryptocurrency. The worker can later exchange cryptocurrency  for the local currency, such as dollars.   This development pointed out to me the safe atmosphere presented with the information being done on an app that had been built with all the safety protocols embedded and was secure.   It also made me aware that there is a trend to use cryptocurrency in transactions which is inherently secure. It just represents money in a safe, digital way.  It is also an accepted form of currency used in some business transactions.   It is traceable. , 



In the meantime, all these tidbits of information have piqued my curiosity, and I wonder what it would be like to build an app even if only I could use it. I have many areas I would be interested in for the most part because I am blind. There are pluses to using a computer because I can make changes that allow me to see pages better, but there are still times that it is difficult to read. I use video instruction too because it is easier to listen, BUT sometimes the written and picture instructions that are included are not done well enough to see clearly.  

Some areas that interest me are genealogy. I could store information about my family that would be accessible by my family. I could then move my trees from the public sites, such as Ancestry and MyHeritage, which store my information at a price. When I decide not to pay them anymore, my work is no longer accessible to me. I could also buy a program to store my information and can transfer my information. Still, I would like a site that stores the information the way I want to save it, and at the same time, my family will be able to access it anytime in the future.  I find that information on the page to be unsuitable for me to see.  Items are too close and print is too small not bold enough.It would be nice to have apps that would help the blind or visually impared users.  

Along with those same thoughts, I would like to store my family pictures and videos and maybe even an audio history but haven’t figured how to plan that out to be  continually updated.  What I like about using  something on the Web3 with IPFS is that everything would be hashed and verifiable for future families.  This is a big step because we have lots of old pictures we can’t alway know for sure it’s validity.  

As I said right in the beginning, I am 73 years old, I have had a very busy life. By my genetic background, I can be around for another 15-20 years and want to be active, keep my brain active, and feel purpose. I would hope that some older and younger people might have some of the same feelings for themselves. It never hurts to learn new things... at any age!!! I hope that you get inspired to learn about and maybe to use Web3, too.

 
Now the first app I would like to build just for me is a file containing names, addresses, and phone numbers. That is possible. But then I'd like to link that to a piece that would listen to me speak my request for information in my app and locate that information and then read back to me the answer. Some expensive devices and services would do that, BUT it would mean a lot more if I did it myself, plus if I built it, it would be just the way I wanted it. I have downloaded a VS Code program and some coding instructions to learn how to build. I have access to ThreadsDB, Buckets, Hub, and Powergate. Then I need to find an audio link to both listen and read. For the answer to my previous question, do I want to learn? YES! So now, I'm off to developing my Audio Read-Write Address Book/Cookbook App just the way I want it.!  

Now to start off though, I think that I should go over to see my granddaughters and together we can try learning a little coding with the Raspberry Pi!

But now it reminds me of some other good attributes about Web3.  In the Web3, when you send an email, submit an order to a store, or even deposit money at your bank, you can do it without a server, and no middle-man.  
That should and does mean less bandwidth. That is a good thing.  
All these requests are typically encrypted. That is a good thing.  
Your orders or transactions can be recorded and verifiable. That is a good thing.  
There are many cases that benefit and could be safe, secure, and verifiable using Web3.   


 

Exploring a use-case that affects us all

One of the first areas affected by the pandemic is the doctors and the hospitals. As we get older, these people and places become more critical to our health and well-being. As it was, those doctors and hospitals surged ahead dealing with those affected but in the process at a cost to the rest of us.

I feel fortunate that I live in a small town because I have one or two doctors that I see regularly, and it's very easy for me to communicate with them. I don't think that some people have it that easy. We saw in the recent news that some doctors were taking to the web and visit with their patients online. I know some patients were reluctant and wondered if that was suitable. Not only physically, but there was concern about personal information. With the laws today, privacy is a big issue. I see that as the perfect area for the development of apps, both written and video, for doctors that would be both safe and effective. 

Based on what I learned this month, IPFS would be a suitable technology to build solutions for patients and doctors' needs. We can go ahead with ideas of giving patients their personal information and past medical history. Do you have all your medical history? If you've moved a few times, you probably have as many different histories since you probably told a new physician what you could remember. With technology today, it should be no problem to keep all your medical history right in your pocket either on your phone, your computer, or in a file safely stored away. This history can include all tests, X-rays, and other images that you have ever had to tell a physician. I think that this is a real plus for us as we get older and can't remember everything anymore. Let's be real about that!!  

Many people have also faced challenges when their children grow up and attempt to locate historical medical records. Records may go missing for many reasons, such as when their pediatricians and doctors have retired or died. I know because when I tried to get records for my daughter, I ran into two problems; my daughter was now an adult, no one knew where to find them. It made no difference that it was a time she was an infant and couldn't tell anybody any first-hand information. Trust me, a lot of people don't want to look for you. I love this possible development too because I believe it would cut down on a lot of repetitive tests done by each doctor and cut down on our costs. The other thing that I like is that when I send this information to the doctor when using IPFS, it goes directly to the doctor and no one and no place else, and it is encrypted as another security level.

One report in Discovery indicated that the use of AI artificial intelligence is making headway for doctors to start eliminating valuable time spent in record keeping and such and strt giving their time back to the patient. I see a lot of this potentially working well in Web3 because of decentralized, verifiable, and secure protocols that would benefit both the doctors and us. People can feel secure that their information can't be compromised. 

The future of Web3

I think that this pandemic is only going to accelerate the use of the Web3 because we will see more adults and children using their computers and want apps that are safe and secure. This leads to another project that I saw at HackFS. The developers have been building a tool for businesses to keep payroll records and make payments. When the information for each record in the file is completed, the funds are immediately available for the worker. The record keeps track of all necessary information, and it allows the workers to be paid in the requested cryptocurrency. The worker can later exchange cryptocurrency  for the local currency, such as dollars.   This development pointed out to me the safe atmosphere presented with the information being done on an app that had been built with all the safety protocols embedded and was secure.   It also made me aware that there is a trend to use cryptocurrency in transactions which is inherently secure. It just represents money in a safe, digital way.  It is also an accepted form of currency used in some business transactions.   It is traceable. , 



In the meantime, all these tidbits of information have piqued my curiosity, and I wonder what it would be like to build an app even if only I could use it. I have many areas I would be interested in for the most part because I am blind. There are pluses to using a computer because I can make changes that allow me to see pages better, but there are still times that it is difficult to read. I use video instruction too because it is easier to listen, BUT sometimes the written and picture instructions that are included are not done well enough to see clearly.  

Some areas that interest me are genealogy. I could store information about my family that would be accessible by my family. I could then move my trees from the public sites, such as Ancestry and MyHeritage, which store my information at a price. When I decide not to pay them anymore, my work is no longer accessible to me. I could also buy a program to store my information and can transfer my information. Still, I would like a site that stores the information the way I want to save it, and at the same time, my family will be able to access it anytime in the future.  I find that information on the page to be unsuitable for me to see.  Items are too close and print is too small not bold enough.It would be nice to have apps that would help the blind or visually impared users.  

Along with those same thoughts, I would like to store my family pictures and videos and maybe even an audio history but haven’t figured how to plan that out to be  continually updated.  What I like about using  something on the Web3 with IPFS is that everything would be hashed and verifiable for future families.  This is a big step because we have lots of old pictures we can’t alway know for sure it’s validity.  

As I said right in the beginning, I am 73 years old, I have had a very busy life. By my genetic background, I can be around for another 15-20 years and want to be active, keep my brain active, and feel purpose. I would hope that some older and younger people might have some of the same feelings for themselves. It never hurts to learn new things... at any age!!! I hope that you get inspired to learn about and maybe to use Web3, too.

 
Now the first app I would like to build just for me is a file containing names, addresses, and phone numbers. That is possible. But then I'd like to link that to a piece that would listen to me speak my request for information in my app and locate that information and then read back to me the answer. Some expensive devices and services would do that, BUT it would mean a lot more if I did it myself, plus if I built it, it would be just the way I wanted it. I have downloaded a VS Code program and some coding instructions to learn how to build. I have access to ThreadsDB, Buckets, Hub, and Powergate. Then I need to find an audio link to both listen and read. For the answer to my previous question, do I want to learn? YES! So now, I'm off to developing my Audio Read-Write Address Book/Cookbook App just the way I want it.!  

Now to start off though, I think that I should go over to see my granddaughters and together we can try learning a little coding with the Raspberry Pi!
